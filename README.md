## Binary Search
My attempts at making my own Binary Search Algorithm

# First Attempt
In Binary Search, we remove values in the array that doesn't satisfy a condition. However, removing values in arrays in C is a bit boring for me.  

So here's what I created:

We are not removing values in array that are to be disregarded

Instead, we assume it by making the program think 

    -  we are reducing the size of the array
    
    -  making index 5 or index 3, any index number as index 0
